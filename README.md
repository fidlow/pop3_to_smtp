Collects your POP3 mailboxes and **forwards** everything to Gmail — by dropping straight
into it over IMAP, or through any SMTP server. A replacement for Gmail's "Check mail from
other accounts" feature, which is slow, unreliable and silently gives up. NestJS + Vue 3 / Vuetify, runs in Docker,
configured entirely from a web interface.

## What it does

- **Collects** as many POP3 mailboxes as you like, on a schedule you choose.
- **Forwards** each message to the destination of your choice — one destination per
  mailbox, as many destinations as you want.
- **Three ways to deliver**: an **IMAP drop**, which files the message straight into the
  mailbox without going through any outgoing server; the **Gmail API**, which imports it
  through your own filters; or a classic **SMTP send**. The first two are the only ones
  where Gmail does not display collected messages as sent by you (see *[Three ways to
  deliver](#three-ways-to-deliver)*).
- **Keeps the original message intact**: sender, subject, date, `Message-ID`, thread,
  attachments and even the DKIM signature. In Gmail it reads like a real redirection,
  not like a bot-generated copy (see *[Making it look like a real
  redirection](#making-it-look-like-a-real-redirection)*).
- **Copy or move**: leave the messages on the POP3 server, or delete them once they
  have been delivered.
- **Per-mailbox settings**: each mailbox has its own collection interval and its own
  per-pass cap, or simply follows the global ones.
- **Interface in six languages** — French, English, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, German.
  The browser's language is picked by default, and one click in the top bar changes it.
- **Web interface** (port 8080, Vue 3 + Vuetify): add mailboxes and destinations,
  force a refresh, see the state of the last action **of each mailbox**, and open its
  own history — message by message, errors included.
- **Every setting is checked when saved**, and a *Test* button lets you re-run the
  check whenever you want.
- **Alerts on failure** by e-mail, ntfy, generic webhook or SMS (Free Mobile API).
- Everything is stored in plain JSON files under `data/`, so a backup is a file copy.

## Getting started

Nothing to clone, nothing to build: the image is published on
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/smeagolworms4/pop3_to_smtp). Create an empty
folder and put this `docker-compose.yml` in it:

```yaml
services:
  pop3-to-smtp:
    image: smeagolworms4/pop3_to_smtp:latest
    container_name: pop3-to-smtp
    restart: unless-stopped
    # Gives the current collection time to finish instead of cutting mid-send.
    stop_grace_period: 30s
    # Writes into ./data with your own UID rather than as root.
    user: "${PUID:-1000}:${PGID:-1000}"
    env_file:
      - .env
    ports:
      - "${WEB_PORT_HOST:-8080}:8080"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
```

Then, next to it:

```bash
touch .env            # may stay empty: everything is configurable from the interface
mkdir data
docker compose up -d
```

`env_file` is mandatory, so the `.env` file has to exist — but it may perfectly well be
empty. Set `PUID`/`PGID` in it if your user is not `1000:1000`, and `WEB_PORT_HOST` if
port 8080 is taken. See `.env.example` for the full list.

Then open **http://localhost:8080** and, in this order:

1. **Add a destination** — where the messages will land. Three types to pick from, and
   it is the only decision that needs any thought:
   - **IMAP drop** (offered by default) — the message is filed into the mailbox as is.
     An IMAP server and an app password, nothing more.
   - **Gmail API** — same thing, except Gmail runs your filters on the way in. Needs an
     OAuth authorization, done once.
   - **SMTP send** — the classic redirection, to forward to any server that is not
     Gmail.

   The table in *[Three ways to deliver](#three-ways-to-deliver)* compares them.
2. **Add a POP3 mailbox** — and pick the destination it should be forwarded to.

Each save runs a real connection test and tells you what went wrong if anything did.
After that, nothing left to do: the timer handles the rest.

### The single-command equivalent

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name pop3-to-smtp \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  --stop-timeout 30 \
  --user 1000:1000 \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v "$(pwd)/data:/data" \
  smeagolworms4/pop3_to_smtp:latest
```

### Gmail: you need an app password

Gmail **rejects your account password**, over IMAP as well as SMTP. You have to generate
a 16-character *app password*, which requires two-step verification to be enabled on the
account first. The same password works for both protocols.

👉 **https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords**

The interface shows this link directly in the destination form as soon as it detects a
Gmail server, along with the *Pre-fill for Gmail* button — which fills in
`imap.gmail.com` port 993 for an IMAP drop, or `smtp.gmail.com` port 587 for an SMTP
send, depending on the type selected.

The **Gmail API** destination uses no password at all: it goes through OAuth (see *[The
Gmail API](#the-gmail-api-untouched-and-run-through-your-filters)*).

### Without Docker

```bash
npm install
npm run build
DATA_DIR=./data node dist/main.js
```

## Making it look like a real redirection

This is the whole point of the tool, and the part worth understanding.

A naive forwarder rebuilds a new message, and Gmail shows it as coming from your relay,
with the original mail quoted inside — replying then writes to the wrong person. Here,
the message is **relayed, not rebuilt**: the raw bytes come off the POP3 server and go
straight to the SMTP server. Two rules make that possible:

1. **The body is never decoded.** It stays a raw buffer from end to end, so
   attachments, exotic encodings and 8-bit content arrive byte for byte.
2. **Headers are only ever added on top.** A DKIM signature only covers the headers
   that existed when it was applied: as long as we merely prepend lines, it stays
   valid — and Gmail displays *"signed by: original-domain.com"*.

On top of that, the tool adds the trace headers a real mail server would
(`Delivered-To`, `Received`, `X-Forwarded-To`, `X-Forwarded-For`).

### Three ways to deliver

|  | SMTP send | IMAP drop | Gmail API |
|---|---|---|---|
| Original sender | rewritten by Gmail | **kept** | **kept** |
| DKIM signature | broken in Gmail-compatible mode | **intact** | **intact** |
| Shown as "me" in Gmail | yes | **no** | **no** |
| Filters, categories, spam check | yes | no | **yes** |
| Authentication | account password | app password | OAuth (once) |
| Works with | any server | any IMAP server | Gmail only |

The IMAP drop is the simplest and works everywhere; the Gmail API adds your filters, at
the cost of a setup on Google's side. Both leave the message untouched.

### The IMAP drop: the message untouched, even on Gmail

A destination comes in two flavours: an **SMTP send** or an **IMAP drop**. The latter
opens an IMAP session on the receiving mailbox and **files** the message there with an
`APPEND`, exactly the way a mail migration tool does.

Nothing is sent, so nothing can be rewritten: the `From:` stays the original sender's,
the DKIM signature stays valid, and neither SPF nor DMARC has any say — no message ever
travels. **This is the only way to stop Gmail showing every collected message as sent by
you**, which it does as soon as the `From:` carries your own account address.

All it takes is an IMAP server and the same app password the SMTP side uses:

| Field | Value for Gmail |
|---|---|
| IMAP server | `imap.gmail.com`, direct TLS, port `993` |
| Username | the full account address |
| Password | the 16-character app password |
| Folder | `INBOX` — or any label, created on demand |

Messages arrive **unread** (an option drops them already read, without a notification)
and **dated from their original date** rather than from the collection time, so a mailbox
collected in one go still files itself in the right order.

One thing to know: a dropped message does not go through Gmail's filters. Neither the
spam filter nor your own rules — it lands directly in the chosen folder.

### The Gmail API: untouched, and run through your filters

A message dropped over IMAP goes through no delivery chain at all: it lands in the chosen
folder without your sorting rules, the category classifier or the spam filter having any
say. For most uses that is fine — but if you have built up Gmail filters over the years,
they will stay silent.

The Gmail API fixes exactly that. Google describes `users.messages.import` as "*standard
email delivery scanning and classification similar to receiving via SMTP*": the message
goes through the delivery pipeline, so **your filters apply**, categories too, and the
spam classifier as well (an option disarms it). And since nothing is re-sent, the
original `From:` stays put — it is the IMAP drop with filters on top.

The price is OAuth. Once, on Google's side:

1. **[console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com/)** → create a project.
2. *APIs & Services* → *Library* → enable the **Gmail API**.
3. *OAuth consent screen*: **External** user type, an app name and a contact e-mail.
   **Publish the app** (*Publish* button, status *In production*): left in *Testing*,
   Google expires the authorization after **7 days**.
4. *Credentials* → *Create credentials* → *OAuth client ID* → type **Web application**.
   Under *Authorized redirect URIs*, paste the address the interface shows in the form
   (`https://your-instance/api/oauth/callback`) — Google matches it character for
   character.
5. In the interface: pick the **Gmail API** type, paste the client ID and secret, then
   **Connect the Google account**. The "unverified app" warning is expected: *Advanced* →
   *Go to …*.

Each POP3 mailbox delivered through the Gmail API is automatically tagged with a Gmail
label named after the mailbox **Name**. An existing user label is reused; otherwise it is
created on the first delivery. Renaming the mailbox therefore makes subsequent messages
use the new label.

The app requests two narrow scopes: `gmail.insert` to add messages and `gmail.labels`
to find or create those source labels. It can neither read your mail nor send any.
Existing Gmail API destinations authorized by an older version need to be connected once
again so Google can grant the new label scope. The token then stays valid unless you
change your Google account password, revoke access, or leave the consent screen in
*Testing* — in every case the interface reports the error and you just click *Connect*
again.

### Two header modes, and why

These modes only apply to an **SMTP send**: neither the IMAP drop nor the Gmail API
rewrites anything, and the interface hides those settings when the destination is one of
those two.

| Mode | What it does | When |
|---|---|---|
| **Faithful redirection** | The message goes out untouched: original `From`, original signature. | Any SMTP server that accepts sending on behalf of a third party: your ISP, a self-hosted relay, a transactional service. |
| **Gmail-compatible** | `From` becomes `Original Name (via your-mailbox@isp.fr) <your@gmail.com>`, and `Reply-To` points at the real sender. | `smtp.gmail.com`. |

The mode defaults to **Automatic**, which picks Gmail-compatible for
`smtp.gmail.com` and faithful redirection everywhere else. You can force either one per
destination.

**Why the second mode exists**: Gmail's submission server rewrites the `From:` header
whenever it is not the authenticated account (or a verified alias). Keeping the original
sender there is simply not possible — so rather than suffer a rewrite that leaves a
broken DKIM signature behind, the tool does it cleanly: the sender's name stays visible,
the original address goes into `X-Original-From`, and **`Reply-To` makes "Reply" write to
the right person**. Subject, date, `Message-ID` and threading headers are untouched
either way, so conversations still group correctly.

> **If you want the untouched version with a Gmail destination**, use an **IMAP drop**
> destination — or the **Gmail API** one if you care about your filters. That is exactly
> what they are for, and there is nothing else to configure on the message side.
> Failing that, do not send *through* Gmail but *to* the Gmail address through any other
> SMTP server (your ISP's, a relay you host, a transactional provider) in *Faithful
> redirection* mode — bearing in mind that the original sender's DMARC policy still
> applies: `p=reject` (LinkedIn, banks, most large senders) will get the message
> rejected. A domain of your own with SPF and DKIM makes this rock solid, but it is not
> required to get started.

### Envelope sender

The envelope sender (`MAIL FROM`) is what SPF checks and where bounces go. Automatic
mode uses the original sender in faithful mode, and the SMTP account in Gmail-compatible
mode — which is what authenticated relays require. You can force either.

### Languages

The interface ships in **French, English, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese and German**. The
browser's language is picked at startup; the selector in the top bar changes it, and the
choice is remembered for later visits.

Each language is a plain JSON file under `src/web/public/i18n/`. Adding one means copying
`fr.json`, translating it, and listing its code in the `LANGS` array in `index.html` — no
build tool, no dependency.

Messages coming from the server (connection test results, collection errors) stay in French:
they travel through the API and the history, and translating them would mean carrying codes
around instead of sentences.

## Configuration

Mailboxes, destinations and preferences live in `data/config.json` and are edited from
the interface. The `.env` file only holds what is specific to the deployment:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `TZ` | `Europe/Paris` | Time zone for displayed and logged dates |
| `PUID` / `PGID` | `1000` | Owner of the `data` folder |
| `WEB_PORT_HOST` | `8080` | Host-side port if 8080 is taken |
| `WEB_USER` / `WEB_PASSWORD` | empty | Basic auth on the interface **and** the API |
| `REFRESH_MINUTES` | `10` | Delay between two collections. `0` disables the timer |
| `RUN_ON_START` | `true` | Collect once when the container starts |
| `MAX_PER_RUN` | `50` | Messages handled per mailbox per pass. `0` = no cap |
| `MAX_SIZE_MB` | `25` | Messages above this are skipped. `0` = no limit |
| `HISTORY_MAX` | `200` | Actions kept **per mailbox** in the history (10 minimum) |
| `POP3_TIMEOUT` / `SMTP_TIMEOUT` / `IMAP_TIMEOUT` | `60000` | Network timeouts, in milliseconds |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | `debug`, `info`, `warn` or `error` |

The five middle ones are **defaults**: they can be changed from the interface, and the
change applies immediately. But a variable that is **set in `.env` locks the setting**:
the field appears greyed out with the name of the variable responsible. Handy to pin a
value down in a managed deployment, annoying when unintentional — hence the commented-out
lines in `.env.example`.

## Alerts

Three categories, each of which can be enabled separately: **failure** (on by default),
**successful forward**, and **every collection**.

Channels: e-mail (reusing one of your destinations' SMTP), **ntfy**, a **generic
webhook** with a free-form template (`{{title}}` / `{{text}}`, enough to plug in Gotify,
Home Assistant, Discord or Slack), and **SMS through the Free Mobile API**.

A failure alert lists the mailbox, the destination, the error, and the first messages
that failed with their reason. The *Send a test* button saves the form first, then fires
on every configured channel and reports each result.

## Good to know

- **First collection on an existing mailbox forwards everything it contains.** If the
  mailbox holds ten years of archives and you do not want them, use the 📋 button on the
  mailbox card: it marks the current content as already handled without sending anything.
- **A message is only marked as handled once the destination has accepted it**, and only
  deleted from the source after that. A crash mid-collection costs you a duplicate at
  worst, never a lost message.
- **A message dropped over IMAP carries its original date**, not the collection time, so
  it files itself where it belongs rather than at the top of the mailbox. That is what
  makes it possible to collect ten years of archives without stacking them all at the
  minute they were fetched — but it does surprise you the first time you collect a
  message that is a few days old.
- **A message dropped over IMAP goes through no filter at all**: no spam check, no
  sorting rules, no category classifier. It lands straight in the chosen folder. If you
  miss your filters, that is exactly what the *Gmail API* destination fixes.
- **Move mode empties the source mailbox.** Deletions are only committed on `QUIT`, as
  the protocol mandates, so an interrupted collection leaves everything in place. Still:
  make sure the destination works before switching it on.
- `MAX_PER_RUN` spreads a large mailbox over several passes rather than flooding the
  destination SMTP in one go.
- POP3 has no folders and no notion of "read": the tool tracks what it has already seen
  by `UIDL`, the stable identifier the server assigns to each message.

## Architecture

```
src/
  main.ts                 HTTP server, static assets, vendor files
  env.ts                  .env → defaults, and which settings it locks
  scheduler.service.ts    the timer (re-armed after each pass, never overlapping)
  store/
    store.service.ts      data/config.json + data/state.json, atomic writes
  mail/
    pop3.ts               POP3 client (RFC 1939), hand-written, no dependency
    imap.ts               IMAP client (RFC 3501), trimmed to LOGIN, APPEND, STATUS
    gmail-api.ts          Google OAuth and users.messages.import: delivery with filters
    rewrite.ts            header handling: the heart of the fidelity work
    headers.ts            byte-level RFC 5322 manipulation, RFC 2047 decoding
    smtp.service.ts       nodemailer, raw sending with an explicit envelope
    delivery.ts           the delivery channel: SMTP send or IMAP drop
    forwarder.service.ts  orchestration: collect → rewrite → deliver → record
  notify/notify.service.ts  e-mail / ntfy / webhook / SMS
  api/api.controller.ts   the REST API
  web/public/index.html   the whole interface, in one file, no build step
  web/public/i18n/*.json  the translations, one language per file
```

The POP3 client is hand-written on purpose. The protocol is ten commands and has not
changed since 1996, whereas the npm packages implementing it do break — `node-pop3`
0.15 ships ESM code inside a `.cjs` file, which simply cannot be loaded. Two hundred
lines under our control beat a dependency that needs fixing.

Vue, Vuetify and the icons are served from `node_modules`, never from a CDN: the
interface works on a network with no Internet access, and will not break the day a CDN
changes its URLs.

## Tests

```bash
npm test
```

88 tests, no network access needed: a fake POP3 server, a fake IMAP server, a fake Google
and a real SMTP server (`smtp-server`) are started on the fly. They cover byte-for-byte preservation
of an 8-bit message, dot-stuffing, folded headers, RFC 2047 decoding, both header modes,
the IMAP drop (literal, flags, internal date, folder creation, modified UTF-7 names), the
Gmail API import (code exchange, token caching and expiry, revoked authorization,
byte-for-byte message), absence of duplicates across two collections, move mode, an SMTP or IMAP rejection
leaving the message in place, oversized messages, concurrent collections, persistence across a restart — and the
translations: same keys in all six languages, none left in French, no hard-coded label in
the template.

They run on every push through GitHub Actions, on Node 22 and 24.

## Docker Hub image and automatic publication

**https://hub.docker.com/r/smeagolworms4/pop3_to_smtp**

Published for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` from a single multi-arch manifest — the
same tag works on a PC, a NAS and a Raspberry Pi.

| Tag | Built on |
|---|---|
| `latest` | every push to `main`, and every git tag — the one to use |
| `main` | every push to the `main` branch |
| `<version>` (e.g. `1.0.0`) | creation of a git tag of that name, to pin a version |

### GitHub secrets to create by hand

Two workflows are provided in `.github/workflows/`: `build_images.yml` (multi-arch build
and push) and `push_readme.yml` (syncs the Docker Hub description from this README).
Both need **two repository secrets**, to be added in *Settings → Secrets and variables →
Actions*:

| Secret | Content |
|---|---|
| `DOCKER_USERNAME` | your Docker Hub username (also used to build the image name) |
| `DOCKER_PASSWORD` | a Docker Hub *access token* |

Without those two secrets, the workflows fail at the Docker Hub login step.

## Troubleshooting

**"Invalid login: 535-5.7.8 Username and Password not accepted"** — Gmail is refusing
your account password. Generate an [app
password](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords).

**Messages arrive from my own address, and Gmail shows them as sent by me** — that is
Gmail-compatible mode, unavoidable when sending through `smtp.gmail.com`: its submission
server rewrites the `From:`. The original sender is on the *Reply-To* line, so replying
works. To keep the original sender, switch the destination to an **IMAP drop** or the
**Gmail API** — see *[Three ways to deliver](#three-ways-to-deliver)*.

**Nothing shows up in the mailbox after a successful collection** — look at the date of
the collected messages rather than at the top of the list: an IMAP drop keeps the
original date, so a four-day-old message files itself four days down. The mailbox history
in the interface tells you how many messages actually went out.

**My Gmail filters do not apply** — an IMAP drop goes through no delivery chain. Use a
*Gmail API* destination, which imports the message through Gmail's own sorting.

**"autorisation Google expirée ou révoquée"** — the refresh token is dead. Three causes:
the consent screen was left in *Testing* (Google then expires the token after 7 days —
publish the app), you changed your Google account password, or access was revoked. Click
*Connect the Google account* again.

**"redirect_uri_mismatch" when authorizing** — the address declared in the Google console
is not exactly the one the interface shows. Google matches it character for character:
the `https://`, the host name and the `/api/oauth/callback` path all have to line up.
Behind a proxy, check that it forwards `X-Forwarded-Proto` and `X-Forwarded-Host`.

**Gmail hides some messages** — Gmail deduplicates by `Message-ID`, which is preserved
on purpose. If a message was already in the account, the copy is hidden. Turn on
*Regenerate the Message-ID* on the destination if it bothers you, at the cost of losing
the thread grouping.

**Same messages forwarded over and over** — some POP3 servers hand out a different
`UIDL` on every session. Switch the mailbox to move mode: what has been sent is deleted,
so nothing can come back.

**The collection never ends** — raise `POP3_TIMEOUT`, `SMTP_TIMEOUT` or `IMAP_TIMEOUT`,
or lower `MAX_PER_RUN`. The history records the duration of each pass.

## Security

The POP3, IMAP and SMTP passwords are stored **in clear text** in `data/config.json` —
the protocols require them in clear, so there is nothing to gain from encrypting them
next to the key. The Google refresh token sits there too, and is worth as much as a
password: it grants the `gmail.insert` scope, meaning it can add messages to the mailbox
— neither read them nor send any. You can revoke it at any time from [your Google
account](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions). Treat that folder as a secret, and set `WEB_USER` / `WEB_PASSWORD` as soon
as the interface leaves your local network: the API exposes the same configuration.

Passwords never travel back to the browser: the interface receives a mask, and sending
that mask back means "keep the current one".
